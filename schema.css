1. Create a new repository on GitHub by navigating to https://github.com and clicking on the "New" button.

2. Give your repository a name and optionally add a description.

3. Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.

4. Once your repository is created, you will see an option to initialize the repository with a README file. You can choose to add a README file or skip this step.

5. On your local machine, navigate to the directory where your project files are located.

6. Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   git init
   ```

7. Add all the files in your project directory to the Git repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

8. Commit the changes by running the following command:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

9. Go back to your GitHub repository page and copy the repository's URL.

10. Set the remote origin for your local repository by running the following command, replacing `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied in the previous step:
    ```
    git remote add origin <repository-url>
    ```

11. Push your local repository to GitHub by running the following command:
    ```
    git push -u origin master
    ```

Your project files will now be uploaded to your GitHub repository. You can continue to make changes to your local repository and push them to GitHub using the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands.
